class ViewMigrationManager(abc.ABC):
    """
    A base class for managing the lifecycle of view migrations in a database using context management.

    This class provides an abstract framework for creating, managing, and reversing database views,
    ensuring that migrations are properly handled with dependencies between different migrations.

    Attributes:
        uses (list[typing.Type["ViewMigrationManager"]]): A list of other ViewMigrationManager classes
            that the current class depends on.

    Example:
        1. Define a subclass that implements specific migration logic:

        ```python
        class MyExampleView_V2(ViewMigrationManager):
            def up(self):
                self.db.executesql(
                    '''
                    CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_example_view AS
                    SELECT id, name FROM my_table;
                    '''
                )

            def down(self):
                self.db.executesql(
                    '''
                    DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW IF EXISTS my_example_view;
                    '''
                )
        ```

        2. Use the subclass in a migration function:

        ```python
        @migration
        def upgrade_some_source_table_that_my_example_view_depends_on(db):
            with MyExampleView_V2(db):
                db.executesql('''
                -- Perform operations that might affect `my_example_view`
                ''')
            db.commit()
            return True
        ```

        In this example:
        - The `down` method will drop the `my_example_view` before the block of code is executed.
        - The SQL operations inside the block will run.
        - The `up` method will recreate the `my_example_view` after the block completes.

    Methods:
        __init__(db: DAL):
            Initializes the manager with the provided database connection.

        __init_subclass__():
            Handles subclass initialization, ensuring proper tracking of dependencies
            using the `uses` and `used_by` attributes.

        up():
            Abstract method to define the migration logic. Subclasses must implement this to
            define how the view should be created or modified.

        down():
            Abstract method to define the rollback logic. Subclasses must implement this to
            define how the view should be dropped or reverted.

        __enter__():
            Context management for reversing the migration before executing a block of code.

        __exit__(exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
            Context management for applying the migration after a block of code has executed,
            regardless of whether an exception was raised.
